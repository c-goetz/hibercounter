# Where?

github.com/c-goetz/hibercounter

# What?

- matches each line on `stdin` against multiple regexes
- first matching regex triggers a sound
- simple "synth engine" for custom sounds

# Why?

- process logs during development without looking at them
    - useful to get an overview how many DB/HTTP requests are sent
- humans can process quite a lot of audio

# Demo
